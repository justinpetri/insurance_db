# insurance_db

This was a project I developed with four other partners (Rohin Oâ€™Connor, Christopher Hill, Ali Shakir, Trystan VanDerAa). It is supposed to be a database for an insurance company in the film making industry. We first used Oracle SQL Developer to create logical and physical diagrams for the DB before generating an SQL document. The vast majority of the code was developed and written by hand (not using Oracle) in order to flesh out the bugs and issues which were initially present. The beginning of the file builds the database, we then inputted place holder (INSERT INTO) data before finally running SELECT statements to output the data.

I uploaded this to github to serve as an example of my experience with SQL.
